PGURE-SVT
=========

PGURE-SVT (Poisson-Gaussian Unbiased Risk Estimator - Singular Value Thresholding)
is an algorithm designed to denoise image sequences acquired in microscopy.
It exploits the correlations between consecutive frames to form low-rank matrices,
which are then recovered using a technique known as nuclear norm minimization.
An unbiased risk estimator for mixed Poisson-Gaussian noise is used to automate
the selection of the regularization parameter, while robust noise and motion
estimation maintain broad applicability to many different types of microscopy.

Quickstart
----------

To install ``pgure-svt`` in a ``conda`` environment (Linux and MacOS only)
from `conda-forge <https://conda-forge.org/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install pgure-svt -c conda-forge

For further details (including building from source),
see the :ref:`installation user guide <install>`.

Once installed, you can use ``pgure-svt`` as below:

.. code-block:: python

   import numpy as np
   from pguresvt import SVT

   # Example dataset has dimensions (nx, ny, nt),
   # in this case a 64x64px video with 25 frames
   X = np.random.randn(64, 64, 25)

   # Initialize the algorithm
   # with default parameters
   svt = SVT()

   # Run the algorithm on the data X
   svt.denoise(X)

   # Get the denoised data Y
   Y = svt.Y_
